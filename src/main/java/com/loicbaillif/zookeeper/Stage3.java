     * The third stage requires you to increase the capabilities of your
     * software. Now it should be able to recognize the number of a specific
     * habitat from the input and show the animals living there.
     *
     * Add all the variables from the template to a single variable with
     * the list type. The order of variables matters: they must appear on the
     * list in the order in which they're defined in the code. The list must
     * contain all the variables with no duplicates.
