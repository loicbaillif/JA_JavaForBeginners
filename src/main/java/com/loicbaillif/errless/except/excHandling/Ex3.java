     * ***** Converting and multiplying *****
     *
     * Your task is to write a program that reads a sequence of strings and
     * converts them to integer numbers, multiplying by 10. Some input strings
     * may have an invalid format, for instance: "abc". The sequence length
     * may be different. Its ending is indicated by “0”. Zero serves as a stop
     * character and should not be included in the sequence.
     *
     * If a string can be converted to an integer number, output the number
     * multiplied by 10. Otherwise, output the string "Invalid user input: X"
     * where X is the input string.
