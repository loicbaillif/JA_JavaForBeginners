     * ***** Quadratic equation *****
     *
     * You are given real numbers a, b and c, where a â‰  0.
     * Solve the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and output all
     * of its roots.
     *
     * It is guaranteed that the equation always has two roots.
     * Output the results roots in ascending order. Do not round or format
     * them, the testing system does it automatically.
