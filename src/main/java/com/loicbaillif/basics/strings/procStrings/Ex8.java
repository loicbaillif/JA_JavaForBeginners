     *  *** The percentage of G and C characters ***
     * GC-content is an important feature of the genome sequences and is
     * defined as the percentage ratio of the sum of all guanines and
     * cytosines to the overall number of nucleic bases in the genome sequence.
     *
     * Write a program, which calculates the percentage of
     * G characters (guanine) and C characters (cytosine) in the entered
     * string. Your program should be case independent.
     *
     * *** Sample Input:
     *      acggtgttat

     * *** Sample Output:
     *      40.0
