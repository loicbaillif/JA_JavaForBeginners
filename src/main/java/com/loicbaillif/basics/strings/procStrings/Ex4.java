     * All the letters of the English alphabet are divided into
     * vowels and consonants.
     *      The vowels are: a, e, i, o, u, y.
     *      The remaining letters are consonants.
     *
     * A word is considered euphonious (pleasant-sounding) if it doesn't
     * have three or more vowels or consonants in a row. Otherwise, it is
     * considered discordant (harsh-sounding).
     *
     * Your task is to create euphonious words from discordant. You can insert
     * any letters inside the word. You should output the minimum number of
     * characters needed to create a euphonious word from a given word.
